            <h3>The challenge</h3>
            <p>Design and write documentation for the Gmail email client, written for an audience that was familiar with email clients, but not with Gmail in particular.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="resolution">
            <h3>My resolution</h3>
            <p>The documentation that I wrote was split into four sections: one that explained the benefits of Gmail, two that covered the main setup process, and a third that dealt with setting up Gmail on your mobile device. This way, the user had all of the information they needed to both ensure that Gmail was right for them and then complete at least the initial setup so that they could get started using Gmail right away.</p>

          <h3>My resolution</h3>

          <p>I described each of the three methods of installation and broke them down in ways that were beginner-friendly, including walking through how to use the command line and compile using "tar".</p>
